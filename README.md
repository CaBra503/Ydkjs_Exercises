# Ydkjs_Exercises


First wrote out 5/4

5/10 bug in function FormatAmount & toFixed() type error - returns not a function.

5/14 while loop only executes first if block, is there something I am missing about using if ... else if..?
Maybe switch & break?
 Â Maybe I'm just over thinking it, this is supposed to be a beginner exercise.

5/15 - I dont like to give up. So I did It my way. Silly thing is finished.
